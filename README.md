# Activae DAM 1.0
Activae is a web Digital Asset Management System. It's open source and was developed originally by CENATIC, the Spanish National Open Source Center. The project was discontinued and I recovered the source code to give it a second opportunity. I'm not the main developer of this project but I'll act as the leader if necessary while somebody replace me (I was the Activae project manager, but not the main developer). Activae supports live format transcoding, workflow, multiple users with different roles and ALCs; It uses standard metadata. Also, it can be use as a kind of YouTube to play online videos, sounds and images.

Now, 54V4NT is carrying out the project towards v2.0 so, if you want to contribute, send your contributions to their fork. See more at http://www.activae.org/
